SCI-DST: Critical Dynamics in Creative CognitionThis repository contains the Python implementation of the Socio-Cognitive Ising–Dynamic Systems (SCI-DST) framework for modelling creative cognition, as described in our paper:Jho, H. & Luo, W. (Year). Critical Dynamics in Creative Cognition: An Ising-Based Computational Framework for Modelling Insight. [Journal Name - e.g., Scientific Reports], [Volume], [Article Number]. [DOI Link - when available]*(Please update the citation details upon publication)OverviewThe SCI-DST framework models creative insight by integrating two-state Ising dynamics with sociocultural fields and dynamic systems principles. This repository provides implementations for:Traditional 2D Lattice-Based Ising Model: A baseline model using a regular grid structure.Small-World Network Ising Model: An extended model using the Watts-Strogatz network topology, better reflecting neural connectivity patterns.The code simulates key phenomena including phase transitions, divergent-convergent cycles (creativity cycles), the effect of associative structures on dynamics (modelling individual differences), and comparison with constant-temperature models (Boltzmann Machines).RequirementsThe code requires Python 3 and the following packages:NumPyNetworkXMatplotlibtqdm (for progress bars)pandas (for heatmap analysis)You can install dependencies using pip:pip install numpy networkx matplotlib tqdm pandas
(Optionally, provide a requirements.txt file)Code Structure OverviewThe repository includes:Core model implementations (lattice_ising.py, smallworld_ising.py).Scripts to run different simulation analyses (run_*.py).Plotting utilities (e.g., plotting.py, methods within model classes).Running Simulations and Reproducing FiguresYou can run the different analyses presented in the paper using the provided run_*.py scripts. The main analyses correspond to the manuscript figures as follows:Figure 1 (Lattice Phase Transition): Run the 2D lattice simulation script.python run_lattice_simulation.py
(Outputs lattice_results.png)Figure 2 & 3 (Small-World Scan & Cycle): Run the basic small-world simulation script.python run_smallworld.py
(Outputs smallworld_scan_results.png, smallworld_cycle_results.png, etc.)Note: Ensure parameters like t_low in this script match the final manuscript values.Figure 4 (Individual Differences): Run the individuality comparison script.python run_individuality_sim.py
(Outputs individuality_comparison_cycles.png)Figure 6 (Comparison vs. BM): Run the Boltzmann Machine comparison script.python run_comparison_sim.py
(Outputs comparison_sci_dst_vs_bm.png)Parameter Sweep Heatmap: Run the heatmap generation script.python run_heatmap.py
(Generates data and contains code to plot heatmap_rho_0.0005.png).Results (plots) will typically be saved as PNG files in the same directory.Parameter Sweep Analysis (Heatmap)(Content adapted from former Appendix B)To understand how key parameters jointly influence creative yield, we performed a parameter sweep.Objective: Quantify how joint creative yield—defined conceptually as the product of novelty (approximated by Shannon entropy S) and usefulness (approximated by the inverse of convergence time)—varies across a grid of temperature (T), learning rate (η), and decay constant (ρ).Grid:T∈1.5,2.0,2.25,2.5,3.0,5.0η∈0.001,0.005,0.01ρ∈0.0001,0.0005,0.001Simulation & Visualisation: The run_heatmap.py script contains the logic to explore this parameter space. An example heatmap for ρ=0.0005 shows creative yield across the T×η plane:(Assumption: This heatmap image is generated and available in the repository)Findings Summary:Yield peaks generally form near the critical temperature (T≈2.25−2.75 in the small-world model), with optimal η depending on T.Higher decay ρ can broaden the optimal parameter range.The region of high creative yield aligns conceptually with the system operating near criticality, balancing exploration and exploitation.Implementation Details SummaryNetwork Structure: The lattice model uses a fixed grid; the small-world model uses a Watts-Strogatz graph for more realistic connectivity.Distance: Calculated via grid units (lattice) or network path length (small-world).Susceptibility: Estimated in the small-world model via field perturbations.CitationIf you use this code or the SCI-DST framework in your research, please cite our paper:@article{JhoLuo2025SciRep,
